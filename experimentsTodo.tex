What experiments can we show the results for?

- On a single SM, run memory accesses that are not coalesced.

- Running a synthetic benchmark, 1 thread block, increasing the number of threads, accessing non-coalesced data and 
observe the cache hit rate. Assigning two blocks (16 blocks in total to have two blocks per SM) and observing the same 
behavior.


- A synthetic benchmark that runs blocks with full threads in each incrementally on vairous SMs to observe the bandwidth.
First, doing in a way that accesses only access DRAM (all L2 misses), then adding more SMs to the picture, and observing if 
for each addition of SM we get more bandwidth or not. Then, doing the same exeperiment where all accesses are L2 hits. The point
of this experiment is to see how much of the bottleneck is from DRAM. Ideally, the experiment shows that if accesses are DRAM-only,
then DRAM becomes the bottleneck, but if they are L2-only, then the SMs memory bus is the bottleneck. And then we can 
conclude that "since applications are somewhere between these two modes (some of the accesses are to DRAM and some are serviced
by the L2), then scenarios exists that SM becomes the bottleneck.

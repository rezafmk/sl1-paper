\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
We first describe the architecture of the Nvidia GTX 680 to provide a brief overview of typical
current GPU architectures.
This subsection can be skipped by readers already familiar with GPU architectures.

We then present several GPU architectural trends to provide insight as to where future GPU
architectures might be headed.
We use these trends to motivate implementing our L1 cache.

Finally, the third subsection presents several limitations of the GPU memory hierarchy and offers some
insights into the nature of those limitations, further motivating our S-L1 design.

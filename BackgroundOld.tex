\section{Background}
We first describe the architecture of the Nvidia  GTX 680 to provide a brief overview of typical current GPU architectures.
This subsection can be skipped by readers already familiar with GPU architectures.

We then present several GPU architectural trends to provide insight as to where future GPU architectures might be headed.
We use these trends to motivate implementing our L1 cache in software.

The third subsection presents several limitations of the GPU memory hierarchy.

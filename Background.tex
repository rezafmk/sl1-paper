\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
We first describe the architecture of the Nvidia GTX~Titan~Black to provide a brief overview of typical
current GPU architectures.
This subsection can be skipped by readers already familiar with GPU architectures.

We then present several GPU architectural trends to provide insight as to where future GPU
architectures might be headed, and then use these trends to motivate our S-L1 cache implementation.

Finally, we present several limitations of the GPU memory hierarchy and offer some
insights into the nature of those limitations, further motivating our S-L1 design.
